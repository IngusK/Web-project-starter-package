Before launching a project make you have the latest yarn packages installed. To do that launch "yarn" command in tour terminal.

To start a development project run <pre>yarn start</pre> or <pre>yarn start:dev</pre> This will build a development bundle with hot reload etc.

To build a production bundle run <pre>yarn start:prod</pre> This will build a production bundle which will be much smaller with all js files minified. Then you can use <b>main.js</b> file to upload it to your hosting.

Launch <pre>localhost:1234/</pre> in your browser to open a project.
