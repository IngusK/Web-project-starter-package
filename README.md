Before launching a project make you have the latest yarn packages installed. To do that launch "yarn" command in tour terminal.

To start a development project run "yarn start" or "yarn start:dev". This will build a development bundle with hot reload etc.

To build a production project run <b>yarn start:prod</b>. This will build a production bundle which will be much smaller with all js files minified. Then you can use main.js file to upload it to your hosting.
